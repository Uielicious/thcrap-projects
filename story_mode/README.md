# Touhou Story Mode
This patch modifies the triggers for ending scenes in each Touhou game, generally to make them more accessable for a casual story experience.
1CCs are no longer required to achieve any of the Good Endings, while Bad Endings can still be viewed by clearing the game on Easy.
1CCs should still be necessary to unlock the Extra Stage in most games.

# Game-specific Details
th08: Bad Endings are achieved by letting the timer reach 5AM. Because of this, Normal and Good Endings can be gotten on Easy.
Stage 6B now allows the player to Continue if they Game Over, unless the time reaches 5AM.
th12.8: Beating a route will always result in an ending, even if Continues are used.
th13: Beating Normal or above with 3 bombs in stock results in the Parallel Ending even if Continues are used.
th15: No changes have been made to the ending requirements, but the "bad" ending is now called the Legacy Mode Ending.
th18: No changes have been made to card unlock conditions, so a 1CC is still required to unlock the Blank Card. However, a 1CC is not required to get the Alternate Ending after the Blank Card has been unlocked.
